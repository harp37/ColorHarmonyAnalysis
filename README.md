Understanding the Results

Dominant Colors - The most prominent colors from your image with their emotional associations
Color Harmonies - Four different color harmony types based on color theory:

Complementary - Colors opposite each other on the color wheel
Analogous - Colors adjacent to each other on the color wheel
Triadic - Three colors evenly spaced around the color wheel
Monochromatic - Different shades and tints of the same color


Palette Description - A detailed analysis of your color palette's emotional impact and potential applications

üß† How It Works
Color Harmony Analysis uses sophisticated algorithms to analyze your images:

Color Extraction - The application samples pixels from your image and groups similar colors using a quantization algorithm
Emotional Analysis - Each color is analyzed based on its hue, saturation, and brightness to determine its psychological impact
Harmony Generation - Color theory principles are applied to create harmonious color schemes using HSL color space transformations
Palette Analysis - The overall palette is evaluated for characteristics like warmth, brightness, saturation, and contrast

Color Theory Background
The application is built on established color theory principles:

Color Psychology - Different colors evoke different emotions (e.g., blues are calming, reds are energetic)
Color Harmonies - Specific relationships between colors on the color wheel create visually pleasing combinations
HSL Color Space - Analyzing colors by hue, saturation, and lightness provides insight into their visual and emotional impact

üí° Applications
Color Harmony Analysis is perfect for:

Designers creating cohesive brand identities or UI color schemes
Artists exploring color palettes for their artwork
Marketing teams developing visually consistent campaigns
Interior designers selecting complementary color schemes
Photographers analyzing and enhancing the color moods in their images
Students learning about color theory and psychology
